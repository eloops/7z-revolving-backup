# 7z-revolving-backup
Fairly simple script to keep N number of backups using 7-Zip and include/exclude lists.

Uses CLI 7-Zip from http://7-zip.org

Edit the file to change number of backups, location. Edit the includelist & excludelist.txt files to pick files to be included/excluded.

I used to use this as a Scheduled Task daily to perform simple backups.
